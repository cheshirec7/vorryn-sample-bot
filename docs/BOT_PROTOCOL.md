# Vorryn Bot Protocol — v1

Wire contract between the Vorryn web server and a bot service. The
canonical machine-readable schema is [`bot-protocol.schema.json`](./bot-protocol.schema.json) — feed it to NSwag, OpenAPI Generator, or any JSON Schema codegen tool to produce typed DTOs in your language of choice.

This document is the human-readable companion: it explains the contract,
the version policy, and operational concerns (timeouts, cold starts,
auth) that the schema can't capture.

## Endpoint

```
POST <bot-url>/play
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <secret>     (third-party bots only — see "Auth")
```

The web server `POST`s a `BotRequest` body and expects a `BotResponse`
body. There are no other endpoints. A `GET /health` returning `{ "ok":
true }` is recommended but not required.

## Lifecycle of a turn

1. Web computes legal actions for the player whose turn it is.
2. Web `POST`s `/play` with the full visible game state plus the legal
   action list (`validActions[]`). Each candidate carries an opaque
   server-assigned `id`.
3. Bot returns an `action` response with `actionId` set to the `id` of
   one entry from `validActions[]`.
4. Web applies that action and either (a) returns the turn to the next
   player, or (b) loops back to step 1 if the player still has a
   pending decision (e.g. discard, robber placement).

The bot **selects, never constructs.** It picks an `id` from the list
the server hands it. This prevents tampering: a bot can never propose
an action the server has not already validated.

### `validActions[]` ordering

The server returns candidates in **deterministic enumeration order, not
preference order**. There is no "best move first" — bots are expected
to score every candidate before picking. A few orderings are stable and
worth knowing about:

- **Action phase**: `endTurn` is first, followed by `skipRoadBuilding`,
  `domesticTradeCancel`, then maritime/domestic trade proposals,
  progress cards, build-road candidates, per-intersection
  build/recruit/wall, `improveCity` for each track, and per-knight
  activate/promote/move.
- **Roll phase**: `rollDice` is first, then any pre-roll progress
  cards (e.g. Alchemy).
- **Setup phase**: one `placeSetupBuilding` candidate per legal
  intersection. `placeSetupRoad` candidates appear on the next
  request, after the building is placed.
- **Pending decisions**: only that decision's variants — order depends
  on the decision (e.g. discard combinations, eligible hexes).

Within `playProgressCard` for `scienceAlchemy`, the 36 `(die1, die2)`
payloads are pre-sorted by descending production-pip weight so a flat-
tie pick lands on `sum=8` rather than `sum=2`. That's the only place
ordering carries semantic intent — everything else is iteration order.

The `id` is opaque and only meaningful within a single request. Across
calls, position N can refer to a different action because the
underlying state changed. Don't index by position across turns.

## Envelopes

### `BotRequest`

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: 1,
  gameId: string,
  playerId: string,                  // the player the bot is acting as
  state: ClientGameState,            // viewer-redacted game state
  validActions: BotActionCandidate[],// non-empty; each has an opaque id
  validActionsTruncated: boolean,    // true if any family was capped
  truncatedFamilies: string[],       // which families hit the cap
  diceHistogram: { [sum: string]: number }, // production-roll tally pad
  recentEvents: RecentEvent[],       // bounded list (≤60), public events
  personality?: string | null        // optional tuning-preset key; bot
                                     // service merges over baseline,
                                     // unknown keys fall back to baseline
}
```

### `BotResponse`

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: 1,
  kind: "action",
  actionId: string,                  // must equal one validActions[i].id
  decisionTrace?: BotDecisionTrace   // optional — persisted for analysis
}
```

External bots may intentionally delegate an unsupported decision:

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: 1,
  kind: "abstain",
  reason?: string                    // optional, max 200 chars
}
```

See [`bot-protocol.schema.json`](./bot-protocol.schema.json) for
exhaustive nested shapes (`ClientGameState`, `BotActionCandidate`,
`PendingDecision`, etc.). Identifiers and action/pending-decision
`type` discriminator strings are camelCase engine tokens
(`"buildRoad"`, `"endTurn"`, `"discardResources"`, ...); preserve
them verbatim.

## Versioning

- **`protocolVersion: 1`** is the current and only stable version.
- Web rejects requests whose `protocolVersion` differs from what its
  bot supports with **HTTP 422**.
- Additive changes (new optional fields, new action variants) ship as
  **v1.x within `protocolVersion: 1`** — bots that ignore unknown
  fields keep working. Codegen against the schema and **do not** error
  on unknown enum members. `personality` (added in v1.1) is the
  canonical example: bots that don't read it still function correctly.
- Breaking changes ship as **`protocolVersion: 2`**. Web will publish
  a new schema file and a migration note before flipping the default.

## Hosting guidance (Azure Functions)

Functions on the **Consumption** plan can cold-start in 3–10 seconds
for C# isolated workers. The protocol's per-request timeout is 12
seconds, with one retry. External bot failures re-ask the first-party
bot, and the final safety net picks the first valid action only if that
fallback call also fails.

For production-grade play, two recommendations:

1. **Premium plan, one always-ready instance** (`alwaysReady=1`).
   Eliminates cold starts for the cost of one warm worker (~$140/mo at
   the time of writing).
2. If you stay on Consumption, expect occasional fallback decisions on
   cold starts. Failed external calls are recorded on `bot_decisions`
   with fallback provenance and `error_text`, so you can monitor the
   rate from bot diagnostics.

The Function `230s` request timeout is not a constraint here — every
`/play` call is bounded by the web server's 12-second budget.

## Timeouts and fallbacks

| Scenario                           | Web behavior                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bot returns 200 within 12s         | Use the returned `actionId`.                              |
| External bot returns `abstain`     | Re-ask the first-party bot for the decision.              |
| Bot returns non-200 or timeout     | Retry once. External failures then re-ask first-party.    |
| Bot returns `actionId` not in list | Treat as failure → retry/fallback path.                   |
| `protocolVersion` mismatch (422)   | Single 422 → use the fallback path immediately, no retry. |

Fallback decisions are recorded in `bot_decisions`. External failures
carry an `error_text` reason such as `timeout`, `http_error`,
`malformed_response`, `protocol_version_mismatch`,
`invalid_action_id`, or `network_error`; intentional abstains keep that
field null.

## Auth (third-party bots)

The shape:

- Register friend-owned bots through **Profile -> My Bots**.
- Each bot user has a row in `users` with `is_bot = true`,
  `bot_endpoint_url` (HTTPS URL), encrypted `bot_secret_enc`, and
  `bot_owner_user_id`.
- Web sends `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` on every `/play`
  request to that URL.
- The bot validates the bearer and rejects with 401 on mismatch.
- Function-level auth (function keys / Easy Auth) is fine in
  _addition_ — the bearer is what the protocol guarantees.

First-party bot rows have `is_bot = true` and **no** endpoint URL;
the web server falls back to the shared `BOT_URL` env var and sends
no `Authorization` header.

## Examples

### Example 1 — Action phase (build)

Mid-game, the player has just rolled, and may build a road, end their
turn, or trade. The bot picks one.

      { "type": "endTurn", "score": 0.0 }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example 2 — Forced decision (discard half)

A 7 was rolled; the player must discard half their resources. The bot
chooses which cards to discard.

#### Request

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "gameId": "9d9b7a6e-...",
  "playerId": "p-alice",
  "state": {
    "phase": "action",
    "currentPlayerId": "p-bob",
    "pendingDecision": {
      "type": "discardResources",
      "actingPlayerId": "p-alice",
      "allowedPlayerIds": ["p-alice"],
      "payload": { "required": { "lumber": 2, "grain": 1 } }
    }
    /* ...remaining ClientGameState fields elided for brevity... */
  },
  "validActions": [
    { "id": "d-001", "type": "discardHalf", "cards": ["lumber", "lumber", "grain"] }
  ],
  "validActionsTruncated": false,
  "truncatedFamilies": [],
  "diceHistogram": { "7": 7 },
  "recentEvents": []
}
```

#### Response

```json
{ "protocolVersion": 1, "kind": "action", "actionId": "d-001" }
```

When `pendingDecision` is non-null, every entry in `validActions[]`
already encodes a legal answer to the decision. The bot just picks
one — same shape as any other turn.

## Idempotency

Web includes the same `gameId`+`state.version` on every request for a
given decision point. If the bot reads the response and crashes before
the web server records it, web will **retry the same request**. The
bot may return a different `actionId` on the retry — web takes whatever
arrives on the second call.

Bots that want stable behavior can key on `(gameId, state.version)`
and cache their decision; this is optional.

## Decision trace

`decisionTrace` is optional and persisted to `bot_decisions` for
offline analysis. Keep it small (≤4KB) — large traces are truncated.
Useful fields:

- `strategy` — name/version of the decision algorithm (`"greedy-vp"`, `"mcts-v3"`).
- `chosenScore` / `scoreGapTop1Top2` — how confident the choice was.
- `top3` — top three candidates with scores; helpful for offline tuning.
- `context` — small flat map of game-state features the bot used.

## Codegen — quick start (C# / .NET)

```bash
nswag jsonschema2csclient \
  /input:bot-protocol.schema.json \
  /output:VorrynBotProtocol.cs \
  /namespace:Vorryn.Bot
```

Then host the resulting DTOs behind any HTTP framework. For Azure
Functions (isolated worker), a minimal `/play` endpoint:

```csharp
[Function("Play")]
public async Task<HttpResponseData> Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
    var body = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<BotRequest>();
    var chosen = body!.ValidActions[0];   // replace with your strategy
    var resp = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    await resp.WriteAsJsonAsync(new BotResponse {
        ProtocolVersion = 1,
        Kind = "action",
        ActionId = chosen.Id,
    });
    return resp;
}
```

## Local development

Web reads the bot URL from `BOT_URL`. To point at a locally-running
Function:

```bash
# In a separate terminal:
func start --port 7071

# In your web/.env:
BOT_URL=http://localhost:7071/api
```

The web server's local game-create flow lets you start a game against
your own bot for end-to-end testing.
